# MY_Python_Projects
Matt Yonkaitis Python Projects


All of these projects are for personal use only, as they are programs I used to teach myself both Python and programming concepts.
These are not all of the programs that I have created or tested, as many of the programs I've written in C++, Java are lost to time. I am familiar with MATLAB as well, but that 
was more used functionally to complete Chemical Engineering tasks that I needed done.

The most recent program created is currently the worlde_research file, or more accurately a Wordle solver I built.
